 """Create a Synset from a "<lemma>.<pos>.<number>" string where:
    <lemma> is the word's morphological stem
    <pos> is one of the module attributes ADJ, ADJ_SAT, ADV, NOUN or VERB
    <number> is the sense number, counting from 0.

    Synset attributes, accessible via methods with the same name:

    - name: The canonical name of this synset, formed using the first lemma
      of this synset. Note that this may be different from the name
      passed to the constructor if that string used a different lemma to
      identify the synset.
    - pos: The synset's part of speech, matching one of the module level
      attributes ADJ, ADJ_SAT, ADV, NOUN or VERB.
    - lemmas: A list of the Lemma objects for this synset.
    - definition: The definition for this synset.
    - examples: A list of example strings for this synset.
    - offset: The offset in the WordNet dict file of this synset.
    - lexname: The name of the lexicographer file containing this synset.

    Synset methods:

    Synsets have the following methods for retrieving related Synsets.
    They correspond to the names for the pointer symbols defined here:
    http://wordnet.princeton.edu/man/wninput.5WN.html#sect3
    These methods all return lists of Synsets.

    - hypernyms, instance_hypernyms
    - hyponyms, instance_hyponyms
    - member_holonyms, substance_holonyms, part_holonyms
    - member_meronyms, substance_meronyms, part_meronyms
    - attributes
    - entailments
    - causes
    - also_sees
    - verb_groups
    - similar_tos

    Additionally, Synsets support the following methods specific to the
    hypernym relation:

    - root_hypernyms
    - common_hypernyms
    - lowest_common_hypernyms

    Note that Synsets do not support the following relations because
    these are defined by WordNet as lexical relations:

    - antonyms
    - derivationally_related_forms
    - pertainyms
